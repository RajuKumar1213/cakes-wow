## 🚀 IMPLEMENTATION HIGHLIGHTS

### React Hook Form Features
```typescript
// Zod validation schema
const productSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(1, 'Product name is required'),
  description: z.string().min(10, 'Description must be at least 10 characters'),
  category: z.string().min(1, 'Category is required'),
  weightOptions: z.array(weightOptionSchema).min(1, 'At least one weight option required'),
  isVeg: z.boolean(),
  isAvailable: z.boolean(),
  // ... more fields
});

// React Hook Form setup
const { control, handleSubmit, formState: { errors }, reset, setValue } = useForm<ProductFormData>({
  resolver: zodResolver(productSchema),
  defaultValues: { /* ... */ }
});

// Dynamic weight options
const { fields, append, remove } = useFieldArray({
  control,
  name: 'weightOptions'
});
```

### Image Upload Implementation
```typescript
// Multiple file upload with validation
const handleImageSelect = (event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
  const files = Array.from(event.target.files || []);
  
  // Validate file types and sizes
  const validFiles = files.filter(file => {
    const isValidType = file.type.startsWith('image/');
    const isValidSize = file.size <= 5 * 1024 * 1024; // 5MB limit
    return isValidType && isValidSize;
  });
  
  // Create previews and update state
  setSelectedImages(prev => [...prev, ...validFiles]);
  // Generate previews...
};
```

### API Integration
```javascript
// FormData handling in API route
export async function POST(request) {
  const formData = await request.formData();
  
  // Process images with Cloudinary
  const imageFiles = formData.getAll('images');
  const imageUrls = [];
  
  for (const file of imageFiles) {
    if (file instanceof File) {
      const imageUrl = await uploadOnCloudinary(file);
      if (imageUrl) imageUrls.push(imageUrl);
    }
  }
  
  // Create product with images
  const product = await Product.create({
    name: formData.get('name'),
    description: formData.get('description'),
    // ... other fields
    imageUrls
  });
}
```
