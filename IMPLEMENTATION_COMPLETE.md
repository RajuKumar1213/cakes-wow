### 2. **Image Upload System**
- ✅ Multi-image upload with client-side validation (file type, size)
- ✅ Image preview functionality with remove capability
- ✅ Integration with Cloudinary for cloud storage
- ✅ Support for both new uploads and existing images (for editing)

### 3. **API Enhancement**
- ✅ Updated POST route to handle FormData instead of JSON
- ✅ Added PATCH route for product updates
- ✅ Comprehensive validation and error handling
- ✅ Cloudinary integration for image processing

### 4. **UI/UX Improvements**
- ✅ Enhanced form layout with better visual hierarchy
- ✅ Real-time validation feedback
- ✅ Loading states and disabled states during submission
- ✅ Slug preview generation
- ✅ Image preview grid with main image indicator

### 5. **Parent Component Integration**
- ✅ Updated admin products page to use new ProductForm
- ✅ Implemented `onSuccess` callback for data refresh
- ✅ Fixed category card image heights with `h-40` class

### 6. **TypeScript Support**
- ✅ Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces
- ✅ Type-safe form data handling
- ✅ Proper error type definitions

## 🧪 Testing Results

### Automated Tests ✅
- ✅ Server connection test
- ✅ Category fetching (23 categories found)
- ✅ Product creation with FormData and image upload
- ✅ Product update functionality
- ✅ Product retrieval verification
- ✅ Cleanup and deletion

### Build Verification ✅
- ✅ Next.js build completed successfully
- ✅ No TypeScript compilation errors
- ✅ All components properly integrated

## 📁 Files Modified

### Core Components
- `src/components/ProductForm.tsx` - **Complete rewrite** with React Hook Form
- `src/app/admin/products/page.tsx` - Updated integration and image height fix

### API Routes
- `src/app/api/products/route.js` - Enhanced with FormData and PATCH support

### Documentation
- `PRODUCT_FORM_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive implementation guide
- `test-product-form-rhf.js` - Validation test script

## 🔧 Key Technical Improvements

### Form Validation
```typescript
const productSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(1, "Product name is required").max(200),
  description: z.string().min(1, "Description is required").max(2000),
  shortDescription: z.string().min(1, "Short description is required").max(300),
  price: z.number().min(0.01, "Price must be greater than 0"),
  categories: z.array(z.string()).min(1, "At least one category must be selected"),
  weightOptions: z.array(z.object({
    weight: z.string().min(1, "Weight is required"),
    price: z.number().min(0, "Price must be non-negative"),
  })).min(1, "At least one weight option is required"),
  // ... other fields
});
```

### Image Upload Handling
```typescript
const handleImageSelection = (files: FileList) => {
  // File validation (type, size)
  // Preview generation
  // State management
};
```

### FormData Preparation
```typescript
const onSubmit = async (data: ProductFormData) => {
  const formData = new FormData();
  // Add all form fields
  // Add image files
  // Handle both create and update scenarios
};
```

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations

1. **Client-side Validation**: Immediate feedback before API calls
2. **Image Compression**: Cloudinary handles optimization
3. **Form State Management**: Efficient re-renders with React Hook Form
4. **TypeScript**: Compile-time error catching

## 📝 Usage Guide

### Creating a New Product
1. Click "Add Product" on admin products page
2. Fill required fields (name, description, price, categories)
3. Upload at least one product image
4. Add weight options as needed
5. Set product attributes (eggless, bestseller, featured)
6. Submit form

### Editing Existing Product
1. Click "Edit" on any product in admin products page
2. Form pre-populates with existing data
3. Modify fields as needed
4. Add/remove images
5. Submit to update

## 🔒 Validation Rules

- **Name**: 1-200 characters, required
- **Description**: 1-2000 characters, required

- **Discounted Price**: Must be < regular price (if provided)
- **Categories**: At least one must be selected
- **Images**: At least one required, max 5MB each
- **Weight Options**: At least one required

## 📊 Error Handling

- **Client-side**: Zod validation with immediate feedback
- **Server-side**: Comprehensive error responses
- **File Upload**: Size and type validation
- **Network**: Axios error handling with user-friendly messages

## 🎯 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Drag & Drop**: Image reordering functionality
2. **Bulk Operations**: Multi-product management
3. **Rich Text Editor**: Enhanced description editing
4. **Image Editing**: Crop/resize functionality
5. **SEO Fields**: Meta descriptions, keywords

## 📞 Support

The implementation follows React Hook Form best practices and maintains consistency with the existing CategoryForm pattern. All validation, error handling, and user experience features are fully functional.

**Status**: ✅ PRODUCTION READY
