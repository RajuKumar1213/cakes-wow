## 🔧 Key Technical Details

### File Upload Process
1. User selects image in PhotoCakeCustomization modal
2. Image uploaded to `/api/upload/photo-cake`
3. Cloudinary returns secure URL
4. URL stored in cart item customization
5. During checkout, existing URL is used (no re-upload)
6. Order saved to database with permanent image URL

### Database Structure
```javascript
customization: {
  type: 'photo-cake',
  message: 'Happy Birthday!',
  imageUrl: 'https://res.cloudinary.com/dykqvsfd1/image/upload/...'
}
```

### Admin Display Logic
- Shows photo cake section only for items with `customization.type === 'photo-cake'`
- Displays image if `customization.imageUrl` exists
- Shows "NO IMAGE" fallback if URL missing
- Clear instructions for printing

## 🎯 Test Orders Created
- Order ID: CWO20250619003
- Customer: Test Customer
- Photo URL: https://res.cloudinary.com/dykqvsfd1/image/upload/v1750316288/...
